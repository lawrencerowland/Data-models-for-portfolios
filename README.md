# PURPOSE

Use a graph database to maintain and visualise a portfolio of projects.

# WHEN TO USE THIS

See https://lawrencerowland.github.io/2020/05/07/Data-models-for-Project-Portfolios.html 

## Option 1: Use Yworks

This is a good way of getting started. It is very user-friendly and requires no code. It is all you need to do during design and set up of a portfolio. 

You will find you progress onto option 2 when you are actually managing the portfolio day-to-day.

## Option 2: Use Neo4j

You do not need to be able to code right from the outset - as there are useful tools that allow you to set up the initial model.

These will build the code as you sketch out your portfolio. You will then be able to open it and query it in Neo4j.

To manage the portfolio, and fully query the portfolio, you will need to learn the query language Cypher, which is pretty similar to SQL. There is a good introductory course on Neo4j website, which probably took me 3 days of effort in all.
