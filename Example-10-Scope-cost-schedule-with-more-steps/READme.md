# Building on Example 1

# Purpose

Example 1 is simple. 
In a new domain, it may take some more steps to 'get to simple'.
Here are the steps, many of which will be taken automatically - but it is worth trying to understand what is going on.

# Sequence

| Straightforward ?                  | Is the Operating Model relatively straight forward ?                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How do you see it ?*               | Set down the different ways you all see the Model                                                                       |
| Visualise*                         | Visualise those in Gephi or similar                                                                                     |
| Improve terms and relations        | Improve the components of the model, and their relationships to each other                                              |
| Iterate ?                          | Do you want to iterate towards a better Operating Model, whilst operating ? (or prepare a full Operating Model first ?) |
| Break links                        | Break links in the model, to show a simplified model for communication. This may be hierarchical or linear.             |
| Communicate w Projects             | Communicate with the Projects / Ops divisions                                                                           |
| Populate task & content            | Populate task and/or content modules for each component                                                                 |
| Dependencies ?                     | Do you want to start thinking about dependencies yet ?                                                                  |
| Populate for edges too             | Populate task and content modules for each dependency as well                                                           |
| Existing portfolio ?               | Do you have already have some sort of  portfolio of projects that are working towards that Operating Model?             |
| Compare tasks to portfolio         | Compare your portfolio to your Operating Model and make first adjustments.                                              |
| Iterate                            | Communicate, learn, measure and iterate*                                                                                |
| Alternative Excel / 3 by 3 Option* | Start with an Excel or Gephi 3 by 3 / 3 by 4 model (OPTION)                                                             |
