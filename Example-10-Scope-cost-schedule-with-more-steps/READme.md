# Building on Example 1

# Purpose

Example 1 is simple. 
In a new domain, it may take some more steps to 'get to simple'.
Here are the steps, many of which will be taken automatically - but it is worth trying to understand what is going on.

# Summary description


# A.  Start with some client insights about her business e.g.
In my business I  need to manage
-Scope
-Cost
-Schedule 
I have the following business functions
-Govern
-Report
-Control
Work with her to bring in other layers. Or work from some company /market data, or an existing strategy. For example: we see here that we need to make decisions fast and in some clear sequence.
1. Orient and decide
1. Act
1. Observe

# B Visualise and understand relationships

{image}

# C Simplify and go out to the business to see how it compares with what is currently being done (Ops and Portfolio)

image of 
# D. Allow the review of the Operating Model to inform changes that need to happen right now. New projects, cancelled projects. New operating procedures. 

# E. Look at what we have learned and start again, to refresh the strategy. Once there has been a loop or two, rewrite the strategy as a document, using the components as the outline structure.

# Starting from zero

[not recommended, but it is a blank sheet approach]
1. Identify the main terms bandied around by the team

1. Assume all concepts are all linked

1. Remove stupid links
