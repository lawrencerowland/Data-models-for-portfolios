# Suitable portfolio context
1. annual business planning process selects and updates the portfolio
2. portfolio of current projects identified
3. portfolio reports exhibit characteristic "tells" of bottom up activity 
4. client curious about emergent strategy

Possible "Tells" 

# Signs a portfolio data model is needed

## Scope
ghost projects
year by year rolling programmes
design projects with general budget for implementation
scope = benefits
change requests coming out at all angles
project / functional characterisation unstable

## Planning / Times
No common WBS structure

## Cost
Unit costs unavailable

## Resource
Key resources spread across several initiatives
the design staff are very requirements-focussed
the BAU staff are very agile-focussed

## Working with the top-down materials

classic portfolio base-line and selection
strategy contribution per project etc

## working from bottom-up
What does the bottom-up look like in a P3 space ?
what project staff are actually working on
what low level internal clients are saying to their project providers
what resistance to project progress looks like here
As-is rather than to-be

## Specific portfolio services

modified benefits / scope categories
new project proposals
