# YEd graph editor: Portfolio exploration and programme definition

We use YEd to look at the relationships between a portfolio of programmes and projects. We see how the portfolio appears to be linked to strategy, and how outputs are intended to support the Target Operating Model for the business. We see how we only need focus on the one or two relationships at any one time. This is possible because we have used YEd to visualise the portfolio as a network of projects and relationships between projects, or other things. Where there is a lot of structure, we can visualise the hierarchical tree structure. Where things are undefined and more confusing, then we can ask YEd to visualise this as a more organic network of relationships.

We have some more information about one project within one of the programmes, including its work packages. We take this from Excel into YEd and add it to our existing visualisation. We show how we can wire up some relationships to strategy and known programme risks and see this in the visualisation.

YEd is compatible with Excel: we can do all our work in Excel, using full project descriptions, and then have a look at what it looks like within YEd, and then carry on working in Excel.

We also have a quick look at a portfolio service catalogue and see whether any of these services can help our client on this programme.

### Other things YEd is good for

YEd has various example graphs you can download from the app. Or you can generate different types of dummy graph straight away to get started. YEd is a graph editor, by which it means anything which is a graph or network, with nodes connected by edges. This covers a lot of things, from folder structures and concept trees to swim lanes and process maps, to customer stories and use cases, to business operating models in UML. There are palettes for each of these.

The good thing about working in YEd is that you don’t lose the relationships you prepare when you are creating a diagram. E.g. if you prepare a diagram showing a programme structure with 20 projects and 100 work packages, then you can use what you have done in Excel, or to create a complete project folder structure, or a report.

There are many different types of layout you can apply: hierarchical, organic, circular, orthogonal, flowchart etc. And when you click on a project (or any other node), there is a separate window which shows you all projects (or other nodes) that project is related to. So, you explore your data or your design or your programme, tracing the logic step by step, to check if there is anything missing. You can also group nodes together into what is called a named graph. So, if you don’t want to see all the risks for example, then they can all be collapsed into a tidy group.

There are good export services, to pdf and image etc, and you can only show the bits of the graph that are relevant to the stakeholder you are talking to. Because there is also a web app, your client can also open a graph on their browser and interact with it, as well as just look at a static pdf.

The ideal assignment using this stuff...

Observe and record your workflow during the start of an assignment

For things you constantly re-use, find out how to make it repeatable as a set of modules

Spend 20% of your effort on assignment generating 80% of content, by using these modules

Then you have 80% of the time to figure out the hard, new client problems

At the end, turn the hard stuff into a new module, and update the other modules a bit.
