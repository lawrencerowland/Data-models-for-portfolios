BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION NEEDS IN Q4

| Trigger                          | Earnings report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Election results>Brexit Jan 2020 | (Today's election result means that January transition under the negotiated withdrawal agreement is the probable scenario, so contingency arrangements can be finalised)                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 2. Margin pressures              | Europe declined 0.3% with volumes up 0.5% and price down 0.9% in a retail environment that remains difficult. Eastern Europe grew well across all divisions and we saw good growth in Italy helped by purpose-led activations while the decline in Germany slowed. Ice cream volumes were down as we lapped very good weather in the previous year.  |
| 3. Home Care as growth driver    | Emerging markets and Home Care have been the key growth drivers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 4. 2019 Stretch plastic goals    | Relevant to the consumer of the future, such as setting stretching goals on plastic use which we recently announced.
