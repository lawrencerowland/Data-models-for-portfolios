This includes an expansion of the licenses for the BPMS (Business Process Management Suite) (including Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)), Oracle Identity Management (IDM) Suite, WebCenter, Oracle Policy Automation (OPA), and Real User Experience Insight (RUEI). The license expansion for the BPMS includes enough licenses for all FDA users. A number of FDA Centers have expressed interest in using this platform for their systems. MARCS has a primary focus on integration across the organization and as the BPMS would help further this goal, these licenses have been expanded to enable organization wide integration. IDM will give MARCS a comprehensive COTS solution to provide the specialized functionality and fine grained security control envisioned. This will require some custom code to realize envisioned functionality. The custom code will be developed under Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 2 - Supplemental. IDM may also be leveraged as an FDA wide solution in the future. The implementation of IDM will be used by every component within MARCS. This has been vetted with the FDA CIO and HHS CIO and conforms to HHS standard security. WebCenter provides robust user interface and portal capabilities. This COTS will be used to implement User Workspace Enhancement Services (UWES), which is part of the Support Services project. UWES will provide a standardized user experience customized based on user role and single user preferences. OPA is a rules engine that will have a number of applications in MARCS ranging from inspection preparation, intelligent questionnaires, and import screening support. RUEI is a tool that can be used from a centralized location to determine the experience that an end user at a remote site is having. ORA is a geographically dispersed organization. In this sense, the user community for MARCS is different from Center user communities since the vast majority of users are not in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. This tool will give ORA and OIM a new ability to understand what is actually happening at user sites and will enable a systematic approach towards improving performance and reliability in the Field.

It provides for ORA wide program quality, sample analysis information sharing across ORA and with external partners, and increased throughput via laboratory automation. ALM aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food/medical product safety; and to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality/Safety of Manufactured Products/Supply Chain. QMiS supports program quality across FDA. This includes the review, continuous improvement, and auditing of work product from the regulatory work flows of ORA. QMiS also directly supports the accreditation of the 16 ORA labs. eLEXNET allows the exchange of lab analysis data between over 100 public health labs at the Federal, state, and local levels including an interface with DHS' National Bio-surveillance Integration System. It is the system for the Food Emergency Response Network and is thus an integral piece in protecting against bioterrorism. LIMS is an envisioned ORA wide COTS solution for automating laboratory work that is currently done manually. This will significantly increase throughput and is expected to at least double the current capacity of ORA laboratories. This is a key component to supporting the FDA Science Strategic Plan. Primary beneficiaries of ALM are quality managers, organizations participating in eLEXNET, and the personnel in the ORA labs. This extends to the public as ALM enables protecting and promoting the public health.ALM will result in reduced response times in health emergencies due to increased laboratory throughput and leveraging external partners and in increased quality for repeatability of results and directly supports the ORA mission of protecting and promoting the public health.ALM has significant dependencies on both MARCS and RBIS for work flow and reporting.ALM forms a comprehensive solution for sample analysis that incorporates quality, internal laboratories, and external partners. It is a proven success in leveraging external partners through cooperative agreements and a useful and reliable IT system.ALM has a planned end date of 9/30/2014. FDA is exploring the possibility of combining ALM, MARCS, and RBIS into one investment since together they support ORA regulatory work flows. This analysis will be completed in FY12. ALM is now being reported as ending pending the results of this analysis.", Performance_Gap:"ORA is a geographically dispersed organization with many processes having grown up organically over decades. QMiS addresses these differences by using a systematic approach towards quality and standardization. This involves a cultural change within the organization and will take time to be accepted.  eLEXNET provides a proven method of interfacing with external partners, particularly DHS. In the case of a bioterrorism emergency, cooperation between Federal agencies and private partners will be paramount. eLEXNET provides a robust, fully redundant, and reliable system to do this.  ORA has seen a steep growth in the demand for sample analysis while many essential processes are not yet automated. All of the 16 ORA laboratories use manual paper based processes.  LIMS is being implemented to change this to automate the laboratories from top to bottom. This will increase accuracy, throughput, and staff efficiency. The demand for sample analysis work from the ORA laboratories is only expected to grow.  Without an automated system, it will be virtually impossible for laboratories using manual processes to meet the needs of the organization.  eLEXNET was the first system at FDA to take a SOA approach coupled with a BPMS. Both LIMS and MARCS are being designed to extend this approach. This provides ORA with an architecture that supports integration and information interchange from the ground up. SOA provides the technical backbone for this approach. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows and enables Federal business personnel to build and modify work flows as graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a more accurate and useful final product work flow and cuts modification time.  ALM fills the current performance gap by providing improved quality, external partner communications, and laboratory automation. This improves repeatability, communication, addresses chain of custody legal needs, increases laboratory throughput, and reduces response time to public health emergencies.

MARCS directly supports the surveillance and promotes the safety of all FDA regulated products except tobacco. It also directly supports the programs of the FDA Offices OF, OMPT, and OGROP, and FDA Centers CBER, CDER, CDRH, CFSAN, and CVM. MARCS is a Business Process Improvement (BPI) effort built from the ground up with integration in mind and forms an Enterprise Resource Planning system that spans all of the electronic work flows of ORA except for processes specific to ORA laboratories. It aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food and medical product safety and enables FDA Centers to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality and Safety of Manufactured Products and the Supply Chain.  FDA uses MARCS to: plan FDA field activities and assign staff to inspections, investigations, recalls, and other compliance activities; track and control samples and the results of laboratory analysis; collect and maintain information from field activities; collect performance data, particularly that related to FDAAA; send Prior Notice for food imports to Customs and accept import product information from Customs for screening; screen some 20 million import lines a year based on calculated risk (PREDICT); collect information about the facilities FDA regulates and those in the import supply chain for risk-based targeting; provide FDA Centers with information on inspections, compliance actions, recalls, laboratory analysis and facilities.   Primary beneficiaries of MARCS are the FDA personnel conducting surveillance and regulatory activities.  This extends to the public as MARCS enables these surveillance and regulatory activities.  MARCS is closely coupled with two other major ORA investments, ALM and RBIS.  ALM provides functionality for ORA laboratories and quality.  RBIS provides reporting and information on some 5 million foreign and domestic firms.  Together, these three investments provide for all of the regulatory workflows of ORA. MARCS also interacts with FURLS, eLIST, and a number of smaller systems at FDA.", Performance_Gap:"Because much of the data and work conducted by the FDA Centers converge within ORA, ORA faces a particular set of performance gaps - e.g., the ability to integrate data in various formats with divergent data definitions; work flows that begin in a number of different states and progress through various organizations; functionalities that are divided into different systems; and the fragility of point-to-point integration schemes that have been built up over time.MARCS is a complete departure from the past which was characterized by organic growth in response to particular needs without an ability to consider the holistic Agency needs. MARCS is being built from the ground with SOA using an ESB coupled with a BPMS and technologies to support offline and Remote Access Device (RAD) usage. SOA allows MARCS to build and reuse functionality that in the past has been duplicated multiple times with different implementations. Now, functionalities can be shared both across MARCS and with other related programs including ALM and RBIS. The ESB solves the problem of fragile point-to-point integration resulting in more robust and higher performance systems. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows. This also brings the building and modifying of work flows closer to Federal business personnel as the graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a much more accurate and useful work flow in the final product and shortens times to modify work flows. MARCS is producing shared services in accordance with point 6 of the 25 point IT reform plan.Much of the work performed by ORA personnel is done in remote areas without network connectivity. This has never been comprehensively addressed by ORA.  MARCS is designed to inherently support off-line/on-line operations through RADs - handheld devices that will improve the efficiency of field staff in completing work not done in an FDA office and when connectivity may be intermittent. MARCS is doing a holistic RADs implementation based on field integration and infrastructure requirements.If MARCS is not fully funded, then the movement towards this future structure will be delayed and work will need to continue to support poorly performing systems that keep breaking down as more demand and integration is placed onto them.

This allows the data to be made available to the largest possible user audience. More advanced users can query the data warehouse directly to support data mining and analysis.2 Standardized firm information that allows for reliable firm identification.  FMLS contains information on some 5 million firms. FDA must maintain information on companies around the world that manufacture, produce, or process regulated items. Within this universe of firms, there are always new companies, companies going out of business, and companies that are merging. FDA receives approximately 10,000 new or unrecognized firms per week. Sometimes these are not new firms, but firms that FDA already has in its database that need to be matched. This is especially true of foreign firms in nations that do not utilize a Latin alphabet. FMLS is continually used to match, clean up, delete, merge, and unmerge firm names in order to provide FDA with an accurate list of the firms that are producing regulated items. This is accomplished through using a set of rules to manage firms, fuzzy logic, and manual analysis. This emphasis on the data quality of the firms tracked by FDA supports all of the regulatory workflows of ORA.If RBIS is not fully funded then data availability, data quality, or both will suffer. The functionality provided by RBIS is closely tied to that provided by ALM or MARCS.  Information generated in ALM or MARCS will find its way into RBIS.

Eliminates redundant systems, and consolidates and migrates functionality and maintenance into a smaller set of systems; while at the same time providing legacy tasks with enhanced capabilities. Provides upgrades of technology in both hardware and software to meet the growing demand of functionality and performance from business. Provides the platform for continued program expansion, such as the expanded automation of support tracking processes for drug product and therapeutic biologic product review; as well as drug safety issues. Meets performance goals of PDUFA. It is critical that the ADIMS Investment continues to maintain and enhance existing systems, consolidate functionality, as well as invest in new capabilities to further meet growing business needs and new legislative or regulatory requirements.", Summary:"The Automated Drug Information Management System (ADIMS) is being developed as an integrated, fully electronic information management system for the receipt, validation, evaluation, reporting, and dissemination of drug application, safety and efficacy data. As the core enterprise architecture for FDA's pre-market drug review process, ADIMS aims to integrate or replace all relevant systems. The system will seamlessly unify multiple applications into one application which will include single sign-on access to information and tools used in daily decision-making. The Document Archiving, Reporting, and Regulatory Tracking System (DARRTS) will be the backbone of the system. Over fifty large and small systems will be integrated into ADIMS, including the Corporate Oracle Management Information System (COMIS), the Electronic Document Room (EDR), and the Division File System (DFS).  As the volume of technologically advanced electronic information coming into FDA escalates, the need for a robust information management system becomes more critical. In addition to facilitating the drug review and approval process, this integrated data management system will collect and evaluate electronic clinical data and facilitate the identification of trends and other important drug regulatory review information (e.g., potential product safety issues). Also, the validation and back-up capabilities of ADIMS will facilitate data verification and correction with increased efficiency. Consolidating current stovepipe and stand-alone drug information systems into a cohesive, easily supportable platform will give reviewers the ability to access information from a single interface, thus reducing redundancy. This will improve data quality and performance objectives, as well as reduce time and resources required to keep multiple systems updated. As a result, ADIMS will directly support the e-Government initiative by creating efficient, electronic access to current and complete information within the Agency. ADIMS also supports the HHS strategic goal to improve health care quality, safety, cost and value by allowing real-time transfer of information. In addition to this, the capability to accept electronic submissions will improve the FDA's responsiveness to consumers, industry, and healthcare providers.", Enhancement_spend_$m:10.206, Evaluation_by_CIO:"3"}}, {_id:271, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Changes_to_Baseline:"3.0", Identifier:"009-000005354", Last_Baseline:"2011-02-28", Performance_Gap:"The ICT21 Initiative designs & builds this purpose driven, data centric environment for the FDA.

The number of sources & data elements increases as the need for complex inputs for safety evidence & efficacy information, genomics, metabolic network & clinical trials modeling, data markers type data, integrated data & networks, & food imports expands. The FDA is increasing its use of electronic health records data to acquire pertinent information for its pharmacovigilance efforts causing expanded participation in programs & initiatives to define of the records standards & networks to assure appropriate data are gathered for use in such activities as safety & efficacy, & genomics & data markers. To meet these challenges, the FDA is modernizing its capacity & communication capabilities by creating an agency-wide bioinformatics IT platform.

In December 2007, the FDA Science Board reported that FDA's mission was at risk due to an aging and inadequate IT infrastructure. FDA has made significant progress in addressing this weakness through the ICT21 investment. This investment established a state-of-the art consolidated Data Center environment. The OI investment provides FDA with the ability to sustain this progress and continued advancement. This investment provides essential IT infrastructure services critical to ensuring FDA's basic operational capability and is key enabler in FDA's ability to advance its scientific capabilities.
