HIGLAS is a component of the department-wide effort of Health and Human Services Unified Financial Management System (UFMS). UFMS is a business transformation effort designed to integrate department-wide financial management systems and operations by aligning the Department's businesses with modern technological capabilities. HHS will use UFMS to satisfy the three categories of financial management systems requirements mandated by the FFMIA. These are Federal financial management systems requirements and the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP); Federal accounting standards; and the United States Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. CMS continues to closely coordinate efforts with DHHS to ensure HIGLAS core financial data integration with UFMS. The unification of the systems is aimed at improving data consolidation and financial reporting capabilities for all of DHHS. HIGLAS is a single, integrated dual-entry and FFMIA-compliant accounting system that processes the mission critical payment calculation for Medicare benefits to Part A and Part B, Medicaid Grants, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for the entire nation. HIGLAS also incorporates internal CMS administrative program accounting transactions.  HIGLAS represents the consolidation of two major CMS projects within the office of the CMS Chief Financial Officer. The first project, the Integrated General Ledger and Accounting System (IGLAS) project, was initiated to improve the accounting and financial management processes used by CMS's Medicare contractors to administer the Medicare Parts A and B programs. The Medicare contractors' accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, and several reporting processes were deemed in particular need of improvement. The second project was an effort to improve the agency's central administrative accounting and financial management processes. This project, referred to as the Financial Accounting and Control Systems (FACS) redesign, entailed a replacement of CMS's legacy accounting system and the systems that currently support its procurement, travel management, grants management, and asset management. These two activities were combined into the HIGLAS project.", Performance_Gap:"The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) requires each Federal agency to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with federal financial management systems requirements, applicable federal accounting standards, and the US Standard General Ledger at the transition level.  The CMS Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) supports the DHHS' FFMIA compliance goals of accounting for the total CMS payment dollars (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and CMS Administrative Program Accounting) to be processed through HIGLAS by FY 2012. HIGLAS also supports OMB Circular A-127 requiring that agency financial statements be the culmination of a systematic accounting process. The statements are to be produced by an accounting system that is an integral part of a total financial management system containing sufficient structure, effective internal controls, and reliable data. HIGLAS is paramount towards the ability of DHHS to retain a clean audit opinion as required by the Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) Act.  The improvements and benefits attributable to HIGLAS include reduced costs due to elimination of redundant individual Medicare financial record systems, improvements in automated Medicare debt collection/referral activities, creation of audit trails for every Medicare transaction/payment/claim in HIGLAS, improved Medicare financial audit ability, and improved capability for CMS to more systematically and efficiently recover identified Medicare Contractor overpayments.  HIGLAS implementation has also resulted in better internal financial controls across Medicare contractor operations.  Implementation of HIGLAS has a significant and positive impact on the amount of additional interest earned (saved) in the Medicare Trust Funds.  HIGLAS supports the agency's strategic mission goal of accurate and predictable payments by strengthening financial management of the Medicare program.  HIGLAS allows for more effective and efficient financial oversight and reporting of CMS program and administrative accounting. If this investment isn't fully funded, HIGLAS transitions could potentially be impacted, thereby placing CMS at a higher risk of not being able to meet the Agency's FFMIA compliance goals, as well as jeopardize the Agency's clean opinion on the CFO Audit.", Business_Case:"275", Enhancement_spend_$m:35.248, Evaluation_by_CIO:"4"}}, {_id:568, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Identifier:"009-000005234", name:"CMS Medicare Integrity Program Modernization-One PI System", Business_Case:"287", Enhancement_spend_$m:2.377}}, {_id:574, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Changes_to_Baseline:"5.0", Identifier:"009-000005317", name:"FDA ORA Mission Accomplishments and Regulatory Compliance Services", Last_Baseline:"2012-02-22", Summary:"The MARCS program is the primary IT mechanism for realizing ORA program goals that supports all FDA Field activities (except laboratories) including domestics, imports, and enforcement.  MARCS directly supports the surveillance and promotes the safety of all FDA regulated products except tobacco. It also directly supports the programs of the FDA Offices OF, OMPT, and OGROP, and FDA Centers CBER, CDER, CDRH, CFSAN, and CVM. MARCS is a Business Process Improvement (BPI) effort built from the ground up with integration in mind and forms an Enterprise Resource Planning system that spans all of the electronic work flows of ORA except for processes specific to ORA laboratories. It aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food and medical product safety and enables FDA Centers to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality and Safety of Manufactured Products and the Supply Chain.  FDA uses MARCS to: plan FDA field activities and assign staff to inspections, investigations, recalls, and other compliance activities; track and control samples and the results of laboratory analysis; collect and maintain information from field activities; collect performance data, particularly that related to FDAAA; send Prior Notice for food imports to Customs and accept import product information from Customs for screening; screen some 20 million import lines a year based on calculated risk (PREDICT); collect information about the facilities FDA regulates and those in the import supply chain for risk-based targeting; provide FDA Centers with information on inspections, compliance actions, recalls, laboratory analysis and facilities.   Primary beneficiaries of MARCS are the FDA personnel conducting surveillance and regulatory activities.  This extends to the public as MARCS enables these surveillance and regulatory activities.  MARCS is closely coupled with two other major ORA investments, ALM and RBIS.  ALM provides functionality for ORA laboratories and quality.  RBIS provides reporting and information on some 5 million foreign and domestic firms.  Together, these three investments provide for all of the regulatory workflows of ORA. MARCS also interacts with FURLS, eLIST, and a number of smaller systems at FDA.", Performance_Gap:"Because much of the data and work conducted by the FDA Centers converge within ORA, ORA faces a particular set of performance gaps - e.g., the ability to integrate data in various formats with divergent data definitions; work flows that begin in a number of different states and progress through various organizations; functionalities that are divided into different systems; and the fragility of point-to-point integration schemes that have been built up over time.MARCS is a complete departure from the past which was characterized by organic growth in response to particular needs without an ability to consider the holistic Agency needs. MARCS is being built from the ground with SOA using an ESB coupled with a BPMS and technologies to support offline and Remote Access Device (RAD) usage. SOA allows MARCS to build and reuse functionality that in the past has been duplicated multiple times with different implementations. Now, functionalities can be shared both across MARCS and with other related programs including ALM and RBIS. The ESB solves the problem of fragile point-to-point integration resulting in more robust and higher performance systems. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows. This also brings the building and modifying of work flows closer to Federal business personnel as the graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a much more accurate and useful work flow in the final product and shortens times to modify work flows. MARCS is producing shared services in accordance with point 6 of the 25 point IT reform plan.Much of the work performed by ORA personnel is done in remote areas without network connectivity. This has never been comprehensively addressed by ORA.  MARCS is designed to inherently support off-line/on-line operations through RADs - handheld devices that will improve the efficiency of field staff in completing work not done in an FDA office and when connectivity may be intermittent. MARCS is doing a holistic RADs implementation based on field integration and infrastructure requirements.If MARCS is not fully funded, then the movement towards this future structure will be delayed and work will need to continue to support poorly performing systems that keep breaking down as more demand and integration is placed onto them. Continuing to operate with these legacy systems will undermine ORAs ability to perform its mission.", Business_Case:"310", Enhancement_spend_$m:20.181, Evaluation_by_CIO:"4"}}, {_id:590, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Identifier:"009-999991400", name:"Federal Health Architecture", Business_Case:"330", Enhancement_spend_$m:3.522}}, {_id:641, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Identifier:"009-000001361", name:"HRSA - BHPr National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB)/Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB)", Business_Case:"355", Enhancement_spend_$m:5.598}}, {_id:648, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Identifier:"009-000236620", name:"CMS HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic & Clinical Health)", Business_Case:"991", Enhancement_spend_$m:19.628}}, {_id:654, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Changes_to_Baseline:"1.0", Identifier:"009-000267388", name:"CMS CCIIO HealthCare.GOV Plan Finder IT Investment", Last_Baseline:"2012-02-24", Summary:"The CMS Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO)  HealthCare.GOV Plan Finder IT Investment funds a portal that allow consumers to search for both public and private health coverage options through an easy to use health insurance finder tool.
