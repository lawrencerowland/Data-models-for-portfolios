HIGLAS is a component of the department-wide effort of Health and Human Services Unified Financial Management System (UFMS). UFMS is a business transformation effort designed to integrate department-wide financial management systems and operations by aligning the Department's businesses with modern technological capabilities. HHS will use UFMS to satisfy the three categories of financial management systems requirements mandated by the FFMIA. These are Federal financial management systems requirements and the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP); Federal accounting standards; and the United States Standard General Ledger at the transaction level. CMS continues to closely coordinate efforts with DHHS to ensure HIGLAS core financial data integration with UFMS. The unification of the systems is aimed at improving data consolidation and financial reporting capabilities for all of DHHS. HIGLAS is a single, integrated dual-entry and FFMIA-compliant accounting system that processes the mission critical payment calculation for Medicare benefits to Part A and Part B, Medicaid Grants, and Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for the entire nation. HIGLAS also incorporates internal CMS administrative program accounting transactions.  HIGLAS represents the consolidation of two major CMS projects within the office of the CMS Chief Financial Officer. The first project, the Integrated General Ledger and Accounting System (IGLAS) project, was initiated to improve the accounting and financial management processes used by CMS's Medicare contractors to administer the Medicare Parts A and B programs. The Medicare contractors' accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger, and several reporting processes were deemed in particular need of improvement. The second project was an effort to improve the agency's central administrative accounting and financial management processes. This project, referred to as the Financial Accounting and Control Systems (FACS) redesign, entailed a replacement of CMS's legacy accounting system and the systems that currently support its procurement, travel management, grants management, and asset management. These two activities were combined into the HIGLAS project.", Performance_Gap:"The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) requires each Federal agency to implement and maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with federal financial management systems requirements, applicable federal accounting standards, and the US Standard General Ledger at the transition level.  The CMS Healthcare Integrated General Ledger Accounting System (HIGLAS) supports the DHHS' FFMIA compliance goals of accounting for the total CMS payment dollars (Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and CMS Administrative Program Accounting) to be processed through HIGLAS by FY 2012. HIGLAS also supports OMB Circular A-127 requiring that agency financial statements be the culmination of a systematic accounting process. The statements are to be produced by an accounting system that is an integral part of a total financial management system containing sufficient structure, effective internal controls, and reliable data. HIGLAS is paramount towards the ability of DHHS to retain a clean audit opinion as required by the Chief Financial Officer's (CFO) Act.  The improvements and benefits attributable to HIGLAS include reduced costs due to elimination of redundant individual Medicare financial record systems, improvements in automated Medicare debt collection/referral activities, creation of audit trails for every Medicare transaction/payment/claim in HIGLAS, improved Medicare financial audit ability, and improved capability for CMS to more systematically and efficiently recover identified Medicare Contractor overpayments.  HIGLAS implementation has also resulted in better internal financial controls across Medicare contractor operations.  Implementation of HIGLAS has a significant and positive impact on the amount of additional interest earned (saved) in the Medicare Trust Funds.  HIGLAS supports the agency's strategic mission goal of accurate and predictable payments by strengthening financial management of the Medicare program.  HIGLAS allows for more effective and efficient financial oversight and reporting of CMS program and administrative accounting. If this investment isn't fully funded, HIGLAS transitions could potentially be impacted, thereby placing CMS at a higher risk of not being able to meet the Agency's FFMIA compliance goals, as well as jeopardize the Agency's clean opinion on the CFO Audit.", Business_Case:"275", Enhancement_spend_$m:35.248, Evaluation_by_CIO:"4"}}, {_id:557, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Identifier:"009-000004611", name:"CMS Interoperability & Standardization - Provider Enrollment (PECOS)", Business_Case:"281", Enhancement_spend_$m:11.369}}, {_id:562, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Identifier:"009-000002454", name:"CMS Medicare Appeals System (MAS)", Business_Case:"285", Enhancement_spend_$m:0}}, {_id:568, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Identifier:"009-000005234", name:"CMS Medicare Integrity Program Modernization-One PI System", Business_Case:"287", Enhancement_spend_$m:2.377}}, {_id:570, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Changes_to_Baseline:"6.0", Identifier:"009-000005318", name:"FDA ORA Automated Laboratory Management", Last_Baseline:"2012-02-23", Summary:"ALM encompasses QMiS, eLEXNET, and LIMS.

ALM aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food/medical product safety; and to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality/Safety of Manufactured Products/Supply Chain. QMiS supports program quality across FDA. This includes the review, continuous improvement, and auditing of work product from the regulatory work flows of ORA. QMiS also directly supports the accreditation of the 16 ORA labs. eLEXNET allows the exchange of lab analysis data between over 100 public health labs at the Federal, state, and local levels including an interface with DHS' National Bio-surveillance Integration System. It is the system for the Food Emergency Response Network and is thus an integral piece in protecting against bioterrorism. LIMS is an envisioned ORA wide COTS solution for automating laboratory work that is currently done manually. This will significantly increase throughput and is expected to at least double the current capacity of ORA laboratories. This is a key component to supporting the FDA Science Strategic Plan. Primary beneficiaries of ALM are quality managers, organizations participating in eLEXNET, and the personnel in the ORA labs. This extends to the public as ALM enables protecting and promoting the public health.ALM will result in reduced response times in health emergencies due to increased laboratory throughput and leveraging external partners and in increased quality for repeatability of results and directly supports the ORA mission of protecting and promoting the public health.ALM has significant dependencies on both MARCS and RBIS for work flow and reporting.ALM forms a comprehensive solution for sample analysis that incorporates quality, internal laboratories, and external partners. It is a proven success in leveraging external partners through cooperative agreements and a useful and reliable IT system.ALM has a planned end date of 9/30/2014. FDA is exploring the possibility of combining ALM, MARCS, and RBIS into one investment since together they support ORA regulatory work flows. This analysis will be completed in FY12. ALM is now being reported as ending pending the results of this analysis.", Performance_Gap:"ORA is a geographically dispersed organization with many processes having grown up organically over decades. QMiS addresses these differences by using a systematic approach towards quality and standardization. This involves a cultural change within the organization and will take time to be accepted.  eLEXNET provides a proven method of interfacing with external partners, particularly DHS. In the case of a bioterrorism emergency, cooperation between Federal agencies and private partners will be paramount. eLEXNET provides a robust, fully redundant, and reliable system to do this.  ORA has seen a steep growth in the demand for sample analysis while many essential processes are not yet automated. All of the 16 ORA laboratories use manual paper based processes.  LIMS is being implemented to change this to automate the laboratories from top to bottom. This will increase accuracy, throughput, and staff efficiency. The demand for sample analysis work from the ORA laboratories is only expected to grow.  Without an automated system, it will be virtually impossible for laboratories using manual processes to meet the needs of the organization.  eLEXNET was the first system at FDA to take a SOA approach coupled with a BPMS. Both LIMS and MARCS are being designed to extend this approach. This provides ORA with an architecture that supports integration and information interchange from the ground up. SOA provides the technical backbone for this approach. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows and enables Federal business personnel to build and modify work flows as graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a more accurate and useful final product work flow and cuts modification time.  ALM fills the current performance gap by providing improved quality, external partner communications, and laboratory automation. This improves repeatability, communication, addresses chain of custody legal needs, increases laboratory throughput, and reduces response time to public health emergencies.

MARCS directly supports the surveillance and promotes the safety of all FDA regulated products except tobacco. It also directly supports the programs of the FDA Offices OF, OMPT, and OGROP, and FDA Centers CBER, CDER, CDRH, CFSAN, and CVM. MARCS is a Business Process Improvement (BPI) effort built from the ground up with integration in mind and forms an Enterprise Resource Planning system that spans all of the electronic work flows of ORA except for processes specific to ORA laboratories. It aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food and medical product safety and enables FDA Centers to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality and Safety of Manufactured Products and the Supply Chain.  FDA uses MARCS to: plan FDA field activities and assign staff to inspections, investigations, recalls, and other compliance activities; track and control samples and the results of laboratory analysis; collect and maintain information from field activities; collect performance data, particularly that related to FDAAA; send Prior Notice for food imports to Customs and accept import product information from Customs for screening; screen some 20 million import lines a year based on calculated risk (PREDICT); collect information about the facilities FDA regulates and those in the import supply chain for risk-based targeting; provide FDA Centers with information on inspections, compliance actions, recalls, laboratory analysis and facilities.   Primary beneficiaries of MARCS are the FDA personnel conducting surveillance and regulatory activities.  This extends to the public as MARCS enables these surveillance and regulatory activities.  MARCS is closely coupled with two other major ORA investments, ALM and RBIS.  ALM provides functionality for ORA laboratories and quality.  RBIS provides reporting and information on some 5 million foreign and domestic firms.  Together, these three investments provide for all of the regulatory workflows of ORA. MARCS also interacts with FURLS, eLIST, and a number of smaller systems at FDA.", Performance_Gap:"Because much of the data and work conducted by the FDA Centers converge within ORA, ORA faces a particular set of performance gaps - e.g., the ability to integrate data in various formats with divergent data definitions; work flows that begin in a number of different states and progress through various organizations; functionalities that are divided into different systems; and the fragility of point-to-point integration schemes that have been built up over time.MARCS is a complete departure from the past which was characterized by organic growth in response to particular needs without an ability to consider the holistic Agency needs. MARCS is being built from the ground with SOA using an ESB coupled with a BPMS and technologies to support offline and Remote Access Device (RAD) usage. SOA allows MARCS to build and reuse functionality that in the past has been duplicated multiple times with different implementations. Now, functionalities can be shared both across MARCS and with other related programs including ALM and RBIS. The ESB solves the problem of fragile point-to-point integration resulting in more robust and higher performance systems. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows. This also brings the building and modifying of work flows closer to Federal business personnel as the graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a much more accurate and useful work flow in the final product and shortens times to modify work flows. MARCS is producing shared services in accordance with point 6 of the 25 point IT reform plan.Much of the work performed by ORA personnel is done in remote areas without network connectivity. This has never been comprehensively addressed by ORA.  MARCS is designed to inherently support off-line/on-line operations through RADs - handheld devices that will improve the efficiency of field staff in completing work not done in an FDA office and when connectivity may be intermittent. MARCS is doing a holistic RADs implementation based on field integration and infrastructure requirements.If MARCS is not fully funded, then the movement towards this future structure will be delayed and work will need to continue to support poorly performing systems that keep breaking down as more demand and integration is placed onto them.

In meeting its mission, HRSA relies on the Electronic Handbooks (EHBs) to assist with improving the performance of HRSA funded programs, sharing data and conducting business in a more efficient manner. The EHBs currently serves more than 40,000 users in managing HRSA grants and projects. EHBs support HRSA with program administration, grants administration and monitoring, management reporting, and performance measurement and analysis. The investment serves HRSA's goal to integrate existing grant support systems into one transparent enterprise-wide system. In conjunction with GRANTS.GOV, this system has streamlined the application and administration process and has enabled applicants, grantee organizations and HRSA to communicate and conduct activities electronically. It allows HRSA to operate in a paperless fashion, with improved business efficiency, and in compliance with mandated Agency-wide and Federal policies, procedures and legislation. The system provides all potential grantees a means to access competitive funding opportunities published as a part of the annual HRSA Preview and to submit applications electronically. HRSA uses HHS ACF's Center of Excellence (COE) for grant award processing. The system provides Grantees electronic means for completing post-award reporting requirements and aid HRSA program staff with conducting in-depth analysis of program grant allocation, use and effectiveness. The EHBs have allowed for a standardization of many of HRSA's business processes as a result of the consolidation.", Performance_Gap:"HRSA does not have identified performance gaps in support of mission delivery. EHBs provides an e-Government solution to grant lifecycle management, allowing more than 100 grant, loan, and scholarship programs to effectively and efficiently support their citizen customers. A lack of full funding will limit enhancements to the system. These enhancements are necessary to meet Congressional and Executive reporting requirement changes, automate remaining manual processes, improve computing efficiency, update the system to the latest available technology, and simplify processes for users. Failure to fund ongoing maintenance and operations needs will require HRSA to add staff to complete grants management processes via a paper process and limit customer service to grantees in managing their grants.", Business_Case:"333", Enhancement_spend_$m:9.736, Evaluation_by_CIO:"4"}}, {_id:637, properties:{Investment_type:"Major", Changes_to_Baseline:"3.0", Identifier:"009-000001405", name:"NIH CC Clinical Research Information System (CRIS)", Last_Baseline:"2012-02-02", Summary:"The Clinical Research Information System (CRIS) supports the medical care and research at the NIH Clinical Center.  While providing direct medical care to our patients is key, as the nation's largest research hospital, data collection and analysis for clinical trials is critical to improving the health of the nation.  CRIS is a system of multiple modules from Allscripts and is interfaced with many other applications to support the Clinical Center's mission of healthcare research.  CRIS has interfaces to multiple applications specific to departments such as radiology, nutrition, surgery, laboratory and pharmacy.  This integration provides a central source of data, images and reports for patient care givers and clinical researchers of the NIH intramural program.  With the core mission of the NIH as research, CRIS has enabled the intramural program to pool all patient data into one repository creating efficiencies and allowing researchers to analyze increasingly more complex data and results by protocol or across protocols. CRIS continues to meet goals set through a rigorous management oversight and CPIC process.  Budget requests are vetted through the CC ITAG and CC executive leadership.CRIS is supported through the NIH Clinical Center Data Center infrastructure as part of the overall NIH IT Infrastructure, which includes dependencies on the availability of power, cooling, network, etc.   The integration that allows for a central source for data is dependent on the ancillary, or department specific, systems that feed data into CRIS.", Performance_Gap:"CRIS is the Electronic Health Record for the Intramural Program at the NIH.  The system is used for all ordering, resulting, and clinical documentation for patient and research care for over 350,000 patients, 80,000 of which are currently active. The system provides a mechanism to efficiently care for patients in a safe environment such as ensuring the right medication/test is provided to the right patient at the right time. The patient data from CRIS is fed to the BTRIS system which is the Research Data Repository.  As a research facility with the focus on 1400 research studies active at any one time the integrity of the data is critical to the analysis of the research hypothesis and the outcomes defined in the Protocol.
