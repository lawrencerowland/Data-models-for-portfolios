It is a steady-state investment in the O&M life-cycle. NPIRS produces specific reports that are required by statute and regulation.  Additionally, NPIRS maintains composite patient encounter information to provide managers at all levels of the Indian health system with a broad range of clinical and administrative information through data marts that allow them to better manage individual patients, local facilities, regional and national programs.   NPIRS data is derived from various government and commercial healthcare information systems that are largely transaction-based systems used to support patient care.  The data comprises patient registration and clinical encounter records.  The data repository provides reports and ad hoc searches of the databases.  Internal users and selected authorized external users have secure access to more structured and specific subsets of this information (data marts).  In support of HIT, it provides a means for other to achieve the public health requirements of meaningful use by providing a public capacity to receive reporting information requirements.   NPIRS supports HHS Strategic Goal 4 Objective A, ensuring program integrity and responsible stewardship of resources, by maintaining user population and workload information attributed to each of the 12 IHS administrative areas. It provides composite information needed to measure IHS performance and the allocation of funds to tribal facilities and provides management with the information necessary to cost-beneficially allocate scarce medical resources.  NPIRS also supports HHS Strategic Goal 4 Objective A by collecting and integrating information from Tribal, Urban, State, private sector, and other Federal sources (e.g. IHS Fiscal Intermediary, CMS) to facilitate effective collaboration and sharing of this information on-line through more accurate and timely reports through the data marts.

RPMS is critical to IHS operations and integrates practice management, medical, behavioral health, population health and performance reporting functions into a fully capable electronic health record (EHR) suite. RPMS evolved alongside the Veterans Administration's acclaimed VistA HIS but occupies a unique place as the only system designed specifically to support the direct care and public health mission of the IHS. RPMS aligns with the Administration's commitment to promoting the adoption of EHRs due to their ability to improve health outcomes and decrease costs. RPMS supports the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) by establishing interoperability through the electronic sharing of information with states, interoperability with commercial labs, and electronic communication among medical staff participating in patient care.  RPMS supports HHS Goal 1 Objective F by providing a Meaningful Use Certified EHR and empowering the patient with personal health information.  The RPMS EHR is certified as a complete EHR for ambulatory and inpatient settings according to the criteria for Stage 1 Meaningful Use, and is in use at more than 300 sites nationwide, including all Federal facilities. IHS participated in trials of the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN) and is progressing in the full implementation of the NwHIN gateway, supporting HIT Principle 3. RPMS is in the mixed lifecycle phase; much of the suite is in operations and maintenance, while modernization and enhancements are planned for FY12-13 for the ICD-10 conversion. RPMS continues to invest in maintenance, including protecting the privacy and security of information, supporting HIT Principle 5. RPMS has incorporated open source software, maintaining an effective system with low cost, supporting HIT Principle 4. As a high-quality, low-cost public domain system, RPMS has also proven attractive to private and public sector health care entities outside of IHS.

It helps guide public health decision making and action at the local, regional and national level. With BioSense, the public health community is able to more efficiently track health problems as they evolve and provide public health officials with the data, information and tools they need to better prepare for and coordinate responses to public health crisis. In real-world application, BioSense has contributed advances to the field of public health surveillance and has provided key support for numerous responses to public health emergencies.The BioSense program worked with partners on defining 90 syndromes and sub-syndromes that encompass infections, injuries, chronic diseases, exposures, miscellaneous conditions and specified ICD-9 codes, and free-text search terms corresponding to these concepts. Working with the academic community, the BioSense program performed research on and provided practical applications for spatio-temporal scanning (SaTScan) and anomaly detection algorithms. The BioSense program created the minimum dataset specification which was later adopted by the Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP). BioSense has also generated details and peer reviewed publications establishing the knowledge and experience about the data analytic issues for timely public health surveillance.The program sustained a 40% budget cut in FY2012 which absorbed much of the IT cost savings of BioSense 2.0. BioSense had planned to utilize these cost savings by funding state and local health departments. With these cuts, BioSense 2.0 faced severe restrictions with workforce capacity support for the states with the possibility of not being able to support some states already.  Further cuts would be catastrophic to CDC as well as the state health departments and the public health community at large. Without the public health surveillance and human capacity support provided by BioSense 2.0, many states would not be able to maintain their own syndromic surveillance or collaborate with other jurisdictions hampering the ability to serve the larger regional or national population as a whole.", Summary:"In 2003, CDC developed an electronic syndromic surveillance system called BioSense that uses health-related data to identify patterns of disease symptoms prior to specific diagnoses. In late 2007, CDC began to redesign the program to improve collaboration with stakeholders and address identified management weaknesses. In FY10, CDC started redesigning the BioSense program based on input and guidance from local, state, and federal partners. The goal of the redesign effort is to be able to provide nationwide and regional situational awareness for all-hazard health-related threats and to support national, state, and local responses to those threats.  While the redesign is planned to occur over the next few years, modification and maintenance of the BioSense surveillance networks is expected to be a systematic and continuous process that will evolve throughout the redesign and thereafter in response to new information and stakeholders needs. The redesigned BioSense program will focus on: 1) improving coordination and links between existing state and local disease surveillance monitoring systems and BioSense, and 2) moving from a need-to-know to a need-to-share  model by building a Network of Networks for sharing information, insights, interpretations, lessons-learned, protocols, and technical assistance.  By integrating local and state-level data into a cohesive picture, BioSense will improve its utility for state and local users. This is consistent with the 2006 Pandemic All Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), 2007 Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-21), Health IT Guiding Principles, all of which call for regional and nationwide public health situation awareness, through an interoperable network of systems, built on existing state and local situation awareness capability.  The structure of BioSense Redesign (2.0) differs substantially from its original design. As a response to stakeholders' constraints related to technology and funding, the Program has shifted to a community-owned implementation where stakeholders will share in ownership of the system. BioSense 2.0 terminated the collection and maintenance of raw clinical data at CDC. Utilizing Cloud technology, BioSense 2.0 emphasizes the direct reporting of data from hospitals to state and local health departments instead of CDC.

The Surveillance Branch in CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) today, is used for a variety of purposes including infection control, healthcare worker safety, blood safety, process-of-care measurement and improvement, prevention research, mandatory public reporting, and public health surveillance.  Over 4500 healthcare facilities are enrolled with an estimated target of 5000+ facilities within the year. In addition to manual data entry, NHSN is leading an effort to utilize pre-existing electronic data from EHR and other healthcare information systems using HL7 balloted and standardized Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents for automated data entry.NHSN  is a highly visible project in support of the CDC-wide Winnable Battles initiative.  The critical priorities established for the Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) Winnable Battle include timely progress on national HAI surveillance and more specifically further expansion of NHSN and acceleration of electronic reporting from healthcare facilities to the CDC surveillance system. The Surveillance Branch also has lead responsibility for developing and maintaining the technical infrastructure of operational systems used by CDC and its partners for surveillance of adverse drug events, other adverse events in healthcare, and adherence to prevention practices.  To accomplish this mission with maximal efficiency and economy, the Surveillance Branch shares human and material resources to the fullest extent possible in development and maintenance work across surveillance systems, including work on NHSN and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System - Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance (NEISS-CADES).

Additionally, a 2009 Operational Analysis noted that the system fails to meet over 90% of program requirements.  CDC then initiated an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) regarding potential upgrades and/or replacement of NSAR.  Based on these assessments of NSAR, management decided to extend the service life of NSAR by implementing two new projects, NSAR 6.0 and eNSAR.

However, the HHS Office of Budget is in the early planning stages seeking to implement the Departmental e-Budgeting System (DEBS). We do not believe there is an overlap between DEBS and the Modernization program as the expansion of budget tools will interface with DEBS to provide program managers functionality spanning budget planning through budget execution.  The two projects proposed will create an information-driven Department, whereby HHS Programs will realize the following benefits: (1) enhancing the accountability and transparency of the Department and provide more financial management information in a cost effective manner, and (2) Create an environment where financial and programmatic data is synchronized centrally from UFMS.  This will in turn allow for more data analysis and managerial accounting concepts to be used and further centralize and strengthen the HHS Programs' ability to enforce compliance with regulatory policy while increasing operational efficiency.  Program Managers will be provided with enhanced reporting and data analysis capabilities in order to make fact-based operational decisions.

The scope of the NBS includes business or functional areas: Financial Management, Property Management, Accounts Payable (Commercial Accounts), Acquisition, Service and Supply Funds Operations, Supply Management and Travel Management. Implementing the NBS has yielded qualitative and quantitative benefits to the NIH because it enabled improved business processes and provides more accurate and timely information which better support the scientific mission of the NIH. The NBS benefits are as follows: Reduce the cost and complexity of doing business: Excessive routing and processing redundancies have been reduced by the workflow management capabilities of the NBS.  Increase service levels:  NIH must be more responsive to its customers, particularly its scientific staff.  The pace of science demands that NIH service and support organizations: Improve service delivery timeliness and predictability; Improve service quality by identifying and quickly resolving errors; and provide more accurate and timely information through more robust reporting tools. Improve managerial control:  Managerial control refers to accurately tracking and managing all resources in order to refine processes and identify areas for improvement.  Informed and timely decisions rely upon the access to reliable information regarding NIH's administrative and scientific support systems. Comply with legislation and regulations: The requirements of the Chief Financial Officers Act, the Government Management Reform Act and the Federal Managers Financial Improvement Act dictate standards with which the NIH's accounting system must comply. NBS began implementing the HHS EPLC process in CY 2009 and continues improvements to the process into FY 2012.  The NBS project has been approved by the NIH Management and Budget Work Group and the NIH IT Investment Review Board most recently on April 18, 2011. Both committees recommend to continue NBS operations and development.  NBS has been briefed and coordinated with UFMS.", `UNIQUE IMPORT ID`:19});

Our goals & challenges are inextricably linked across all partners & stakeholders.  OCSE faces the challenges of ensuring states have appropriate tools & resources to efficiently locate child support case participants, establish & collect financial support for children, while facilitating cost-efficient & effective information sharing across & among a disparate group of program partners.   CSEAs face the loss of already limited budget & staff resources.  Federal agencies have other priorities & budget & resource constraints that hinder their ability to provide support to the child support community.  Employers, financial institutions & insurers also have limited resources & budgets, & are often overwhelmed by the volume of requests for action from the child support community.  Critical program partners have been forced, because of resource issues, to leave extras like IT infrastructure & non-core customer support functions on hold. To facilitate achievement of OCSE, ACF and HHS goals in a technologically innovative & cost-efficient manner, & in response to the economic & resource crises facing our program partners & stakeholders, FPLS provides a variety of services, removing barriers to providing services to stakeholders & increasing the program's ability to provide the best customer service. HHS recognizes that FPLS is critical to its mission:  HHS recently identified FPLS to the OMB E-Gov Office as 1 of 4 Key IT investments that demonstrate how IT supports agency programs. HHS also selected a component of FPLS, Enterprise Services Portal, to be included in its Customer Service Plan, developed in response to E.O. 13571 requiring agencies to develop plans to identify their highest volume services focused on streamlining service delivery & improving customer experiences. HHS selected FPLS because it is comprehensive-focused on all OCSE customers, partners & stakeholders, supportive of the child support program mission, & provides effective, efficient & repeatable processes & systems at minimal or no cost to child support program partners. Failure to fully fund the FPLS will result in significant, negative impacts to the national child support program in general, & to children & families in particular.", Summary:"In FY10, FPLS helped collect over $26.5B in child support, incl. $3.4B in federal collections. FPLS aligns w/ & supports HHS goals to advance health, safety & well-being of the American people by promoting economic & social well-being of individuals, families & communities thru collecting support & assisting in obtaining health care coverage for children. FPLS enables Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) to meet its & state child support program missions & increase collections by facilitating communication & data exchanges w/states, employers, multistate financial institutions, insurers & other federal agencies & using FPLS data to locate parents delinquent in support. FPLS is comprised of multiple systems, incl. 4 that are critical: National Directory of New Hires (NDNH), a database of employment data; Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders (FCR), a database of child support cases & orders; Debtor File, which assists states w/collection of delinquent child support; & Enterprise Services Portal (ESP), which provides authorized users a secure gateway into FPLS web applications. NDNH data matches resulted in national child support collections of about $428M in FY10, & FOP collected $2.1B. FPLS also supports HHS goals to increase efficiency, transparency & accountability by ensuring program integrity & resource stewardship & by fighting fraud, waste & abuse. FPLS data are used to reduce erroneous payments & costs in public assistance programs, contributing directly to government-wide initiatives to reduce improper payments. FPLS eliminates barriers between gov't agencies & promotes data sharing to improve program efficiencies & customer service by providing a centralized source of employment & location data for authorized programs. In FY09, SSA estimated benefits of NDNH matching of about $652M in prevention of future overpayments & adjustments of incorrect payment amounts in Supplemental Security Income. In PY10, IRS used FCR & other data to recover over $438M in additional taxes. HUD estimated the subsidy error in FY10 for rental housing assistance programs identified using NDNH data to be $203M.

Without VTrckS, the level of command and control allowing rapid and effective response to special vaccine related situations, including a supply chain disruption (e.g. manufacturing shortage), national emergency (e.g. epidemic requiring rapid vaccine transfers), new vaccine release, or widespread crisis events (e.g. pandemic similar to the H1N1 event of 2009-2010) is severely limited. VTrckS supports CDC's management of the publicly funded vaccine supply chain by providing near real-time data used to assess grantee and provider ordering patterns and accountability efforts. This investment improves allocation, management, and distribution of public-sector vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) as essential for the health of our nation's most vulnerable children, adolescents, and adults. Additionally, administrative burdens for grantee staff are significantly reduced with VTrckS applications by providing real-time inventory visibility, formulary management, security management, and direct provider vaccine ordering capability. The VTrckS investment should allow vital and limited grantee resources to focus on primary public health activities and improve immunization coverage levels of the pediatric population.Without full funding, CDC would have to revert to home-grown legacy systems that were not designed for the current, much less the future, order volumes, and for which there is a scarcity of system support personnel. Due to the lack of integration, the legacy systems and support staff are impaired by manual processes impacting internal control over budgets, contracts, and order accuracy.  Additionally, the distributor and the manufacturers have already converted their systems and new interfaces would be required to re-integrate with the legacy systems.  Thus for reasons of risk management and vaccine delivery efficiency, especially evident during a public health event requiring inventory allocation and reassignment decisions, the VTrckS enterprise resource planning solution is best-suited for vaccine management supporting HHS' Strategic Plan; Goal 4 (Increase Efficiency, Transparency, and Accountability of HHS Programs) and Goal 5 (Strengthen the Nation's Health and Human Service Infrastructure and Workforce).", Summary:"The Vaccine Tracking System (VTrckS) is a critical component of the Vaccine Management Business Improvement Project (VMBIP), an HHS initiative to improve current vaccine management processes around public purchased vaccine at the federal, state, and local levels. VTrckS will provide capabilities to allow the CDC to manage more than $4 billion of vaccines associated with the Vaccines for Children (VFC) and Section 317 grantee funded programs. VTrckS is an enterprise system used to track federally contracted vaccine orders between manufacturers, distributor, and health care providers. VTrckS pilot implementation began in December 2010 with four pilot sites. After go-live, pilot grantees and internal users provided significant feedback for the need for enhancements and optimizations before further scale up of the system. These optimizations will be released to the pilot grantees in Feb 2012. Further rollout to the non-pilot grantees will begin in April 2012 with rollout completion in June 2013. As a Web-based system for provider ordering and automated approvals, it will improve operational efficiencies and internal controls. VTrckS is a comprehensive IT solution that eliminates current legacy system limitations, provides a scalable platform and improves vaccine management.

If not fully funded, this will impact all levels of government, including reduction of 112 state personnel in 56 jurisdictions, slow down the adoption of standards-based ELR and case notification from states to CDC programs under NNDSS, and reduction of coverage by CDC to provide application, tools, training, and technical assistance to states.", Summary:"NEDSS (National Electronic Disease Surveillance System) is an initiative that promotes an Internet-based infrastructure for public health surveillance data exchange that uses PHIN (Public Health Information Network) Data Standards and includes interoperable subsystems, components, systems modules, and applications developed and implemented by CDC, state and local health departments, and commercial vendors.  NEDSS relies heavily on industry standards (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED, HL7), and policy-level agreements on data access/ protection of confidentiality.  NEDSS represents an ongoing close collaboration between the CDC and its public health partners.   When NEDSS began in 2001, no state had integrated public health surveillance systems as articulated in the NEDSS vision; today over 50 jurisdictions have implemented surveillance systems based on this vision.  CDC responded to requests from states seeking assistance to obtain NEDSS software solutions, often based on local and state information technology resource constraints by developing the CDC NEDSS Base System (NBS). Today, 18 states and one territory use the NBS.    NEDSS specific goals and planned achievements that will align with the Health IT Guidance Memo Policy Principle of measurably improve long term outcomes.

In addition to basic case tracking across all levels of Medicare appeals in a unified system, the MAS provides the capability to report on appeals data, enable more accurate and expedient responses to Congressional questions, and provide more precise data for assessment and policy-setting. MAS fulfills these business needs by focusing on data collection, data analysis, and workflow management. The MAS is capable of docketing/calendaring hearings, scheduling expert witnesses for testimony, and providing information on the Medicare appeals workload as it relates to the number of ALJs and support staff required to process appeals. Moreover, the MAS envisions a future environment in which all of the management of the appeal files will be handled electronically. Specifically, the ALJ would have electronic access to all necessary documents, prior decisions, and other relevant information. MAS also supports fraud and abuse efforts because it now provides appeals outcomes and statistics to the Recovery Audit Contractors.", name:"CMS Medicare Appeals System (MAS)", `UNIQUE IMPORT ID`:45});

There are many shortfalls of the existing data mining systems such as lack of standardization.  The contractor(s) and law enforcement's capabilities vary widely in terms of analytic capacity, data processing approach, and even the CMS data that are available to them. Another shortfall is within the tools being used to access the data.  The contractor(s) and law enforcement's current process lack of means for easy cooperation and sharing; multiple analysis tools resulting in inconsistent outcomes; multiple sources of data; multiple and varied analysis processes resulting in inconsistent outcomes.  Finally, there was a lack of, or disparity in, measurable success criteria.  The One PI system is designed to modernize CMS' approach to combating fraud, waste and abuse and address each of the challenges. Contractors will all have access to in depth, current data that many do not have access to today. For the first time, integrated data across all parts of Medicare will provide a comprehensive picture of providers or beneficiaries. The new data model, developed by One PI in partnership with the IDR, also supports the integration of Medicaid data. Data on episodes of care and episodes of admission can be used to see variations in treatment and cost across the nation or in particular areas or for specific providers. The new tools available to all users, allow standardized reports or complex queries to be made available to all contractors. The reduction in time running routine reports and queries will allow analysts to concentrate on innovation approaches to investigating fraud, waste and abuse. One PI also provides a collaboration capability that will allow analysts to share methodologies and to build on each other's work.If this investment is not funded, the loss of funds to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse, which has been estimated by DOJ to be as high as 10% of expenditures, will continue at current levels. The PI contractors efforts will continue to be limited to disparate, inconsistent data with no ability to perform national analysis.", Summary:"The purpose of the One PI system is to establish an enterprise resource as a single source of information for all CMS fraud, waste, and abuse activities. The project will, for the first time, provide streamlined, centralized access and analysis for standardized Medicaid data across multiple states, integrated with data from Medicare Parts A, B, and D. The availability of a centralized source for accessing the tremendous volume of data on claims, providers, and beneficiaries will enable consistent, reliable, and timely analyses, improving the ability to detect fraud, waste, and abuse in both programs. The project supports the HHS strategic initiatives, addresses legislative requirements, and will provide support to 3 systems in OMB's PART program: Medicare, Medicaid, and Health Care Fraud.  The project will allow for the efficient expansion of the agency's Medi-Medi data match project as required in the DRA of 2005. Centralizing Medicare and Medicaid data in this one system will create efficiencies for many of CMS's offices and their contractors along with different law enforcement agencies.  The effort supports provisions in the BIPA of 2000 and the Part D program components of the MMA of 2003. The program will meet a key functional goal of the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by providing increased tools to combat fraud, waste and abuse.  The HHS strategic initiative to Ensure program integrity and responsible stewardship has been the primary goal of the modernization program since its start. The robust, integrated data sources developed by One PI will provide significant support to the efforts to Transform health-care by providing an analytic platform and reducing unnecessary costs. There is a dependency between the One-PI and the Integrated Data Repository (IDR) investment.  The program completed the process of migrating to the IDR in 2010 and 2011.

QMiS addresses these differences by using a systematic approach towards quality and standardization. This involves a cultural change within the organization and will take time to be accepted.  eLEXNET provides a proven method of interfacing with external partners, particularly DHS. In the case of a bioterrorism emergency, cooperation between Federal agencies and private partners will be paramount. eLEXNET provides a robust, fully redundant, and reliable system to do this.  ORA has seen a steep growth in the demand for sample analysis while many essential processes are not yet automated. All of the 16 ORA laboratories use manual paper based processes.  LIMS is being implemented to change this to automate the laboratories from top to bottom. This will increase accuracy, throughput, and staff efficiency. The demand for sample analysis work from the ORA laboratories is only expected to grow.  Without an automated system, it will be virtually impossible for laboratories using manual processes to meet the needs of the organization.  eLEXNET was the first system at FDA to take a SOA approach coupled with a BPMS. Both LIMS and MARCS are being designed to extend this approach. This provides ORA with an architecture that supports integration and information interchange from the ground up. SOA provides the technical backbone for this approach. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows and enables Federal business personnel to build and modify work flows as graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a more accurate and useful final product work flow and cuts modification time.  ALM fills the current performance gap by providing improved quality, external partner communications, and laboratory automation. This improves repeatability, communication, addresses chain of custody legal needs, increases laboratory throughput, and reduces response time to public health emergencies.  Not fully funding ALM will delay these benefits and could result in ORA laboratories not being able to process samples as needed by the organization.", Summary:"ALM encompasses QMiS, eLEXNET, and LIMS. It provides for ORA wide program quality, sample analysis information sharing across ORA and with external partners, and increased throughput via laboratory automation. ALM aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food/medical product safety; and to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality/Safety of Manufactured Products/Supply Chain. QMiS supports program quality across FDA. This includes the review, continuous improvement, and auditing of work product from the regulatory work flows of ORA. QMiS also directly supports the accreditation of the 16 ORA labs. eLEXNET allows the exchange of lab analysis data between over 100 public health labs at the Federal, state, and local levels including an interface with DHS' National Bio-surveillance Integration System. It is the system for the Food Emergency Response Network and is thus an integral piece in protecting against bioterrorism. LIMS is an envisioned ORA wide COTS solution for automating laboratory work that is currently done manually. This will significantly increase throughput and is expected to at least double the current capacity of ORA laboratories. This is a key component to supporting the FDA Science Strategic Plan. Primary beneficiaries of ALM are quality managers, organizations participating in eLEXNET, and the personnel in the ORA labs. This extends to the public as ALM enables protecting and promoting the public health.ALM will result in reduced response times in health emergencies due to increased laboratory throughput and leveraging external partners and in increased quality for repeatability of results and directly supports the ORA mission of protecting and promoting the public health.ALM has significant dependencies on both MARCS and RBIS for work flow and reporting.ALM forms a comprehensive solution for sample analysis that incorporates quality, internal laboratories, and external partners. It is a proven success in leveraging external partners through cooperative agreements and a useful and reliable IT system.ALM has a planned end date of 9/30/2014.

MARCS is being built from the ground with SOA using an ESB coupled with a BPMS and technologies to support offline and Remote Access Device (RAD) usage. SOA allows MARCS to build and reuse functionality that in the past has been duplicated multiple times with different implementations. Now, functionalities can be shared both across MARCS and with other related programs including ALM and RBIS. The ESB solves the problem of fragile point-to-point integration resulting in more robust and higher performance systems. The BPMS standardizes the approach to defining, describing, mapping, and implementing work flows. This also brings the building and modifying of work flows closer to Federal business personnel as the graphical and English language tools do not require a technical background. This produces a much more accurate and useful work flow in the final product and shortens times to modify work flows. MARCS is producing shared services in accordance with point 6 of the 25 point IT reform plan.Much of the work performed by ORA personnel is done in remote areas without network connectivity. This has never been comprehensively addressed by ORA.  MARCS is designed to inherently support off-line/on-line operations through RADs - handheld devices that will improve the efficiency of field staff in completing work not done in an FDA office and when connectivity may be intermittent. MARCS is doing a holistic RADs implementation based on field integration and infrastructure requirements.If MARCS is not fully funded, then the movement towards this future structure will be delayed and work will need to continue to support poorly performing systems that keep breaking down as more demand and integration is placed onto them. Continuing to operate with these legacy systems will undermine ORAs ability to perform its mission.", Summary:"The MARCS program is the primary IT mechanism for realizing ORA program goals that supports all FDA Field activities (except laboratories) including domestics, imports, and enforcement.

MARCS is a Business Process Improvement (BPI) effort built from the ground up with integration in mind and forms an Enterprise Resource Planning system that spans all of the electronic work flows of ORA except for processes specific to ORA laboratories. It aligns directly with Strategic Goal 2, Objective C of the HHS strategic plan: Advance Scientific Knowledge and Innovation; Invest in the regulatory sciences to improve food and medical product safety and enables FDA Centers to meet FDA Strategic Goal 4: Improve the Quality and Safety of Manufactured Products and the Supply Chain.  FDA uses MARCS to: plan FDA field activities and assign staff to inspections, investigations, recalls, and other compliance activities; track and control samples and the results of laboratory analysis; collect and maintain information from field activities; collect performance data, particularly that related to FDAAA; send Prior Notice for food imports to Customs and accept import product information from Customs for screening; screen some 20 million import lines a year based on calculated risk (PREDICT); collect information about the facilities FDA regulates and those in the import supply chain for risk-based targeting; provide FDA Centers with information on inspections, compliance actions, recalls, laboratory analysis and facilities.   Primary beneficiaries of MARCS are the FDA personnel conducting surveillance and regulatory activities.  This extends to the public as MARCS enables these surveillance and regulatory activities.  MARCS is closely coupled with two other major ORA investments, ALM and RBIS.  ALM provides functionality for ORA laboratories and quality.

This allows the data to be made available to the largest possible user audience. More advanced users can query the data warehouse directly to support data mining and analysis.2 Standardized firm information that allows for reliable firm identification.  FMLS contains information on some 5 million firms. FDA must maintain information on companies around the world that manufacture, produce, or process regulated items. Within this universe of firms, there are always new companies, companies going out of business, and companies that are merging. FDA receives approximately 10,000 new or unrecognized firms per week. Sometimes these are not new firms, but firms that FDA already has in its database that need to be matched. This is especially true of foreign firms in nations that do not utilize a Latin alphabet. FMLS is continually used to match, clean up, delete, merge, and unmerge firm names in order to provide FDA with an accurate list of the firms that are producing regulated items. This is accomplished through using a set of rules to manage firms, fuzzy logic, and manual analysis. This emphasis on the data quality of the firms tracked by FDA supports all of the regulatory workflows of ORA.If RBIS is not fully funded then data availability, data quality, or both will suffer.

FHA and its Federal partners are helping build a Federal health information technology environment that is interoperable with private sector systems and supports the President's plan to enable better point-of-service care, increased efficiency and improved overall health in the U.S. population. FHA, together with its Federal partners, addresses the requirements of EO 13410 to achieve secure, interoperable health information exchanges within the Federal Government and its consortia. FHA uses a three-step process to provide products and services that advance adoption of interoperable health information transmission among health stakeholders -- identify business needs, furnish tools and products, and provide implementation support. The FHA serves a coordinating and convening role across the Federal agencies to support alignment of HIT investments. This has led to the CONNECT Gateway project, the Federal Health Information Modeling (FHIM) initiative, Federal Health Information Planning and Reporting (FHIPR) and other projects aimed at coordinating across Federal agencies. FHA initiated FHIM to develop a comprehensive, integrated set of standards that fully support health information interoperability, including semantic interoperability. Included in this initiative is information modeling, the goal of which is to produce a logical, health information model that supports semantic interoperability and that is built by harmonizing information from the Federal partners and standards organizations. FHA created the FHIPR initiative to provide health IT specific guidance to agencies for the purposes of planning health IT investments and reporting to OMB.

In 2006, Executive Order 13410 required healthcare programs administered or sponsored by the Federal government to promote quality and efficient delivery through the use of health information technology. HHS was tasked with developing a program to assist agencies to meet EO 13410 and monitor their progress. Subsequently, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was established. The FHA is a partnership among Federal Agencies and the OMB, and managed by ONC with HHS, acting as the Managing Partner, along with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, acting as Lead Partners, provides funding for the program. These agencies collaborate to advance health information interoperability between Federal Agencies, and between agencies and the tribal, state, local and private sectors.Through the FHA program, Federal Agencies have joined together to rapidly and efficiently implement government-wide solutions for interoperable and secure health information exchange that address agency business priorities, while protecting citizen privacy.

Effective professional peer review can restrict the ability of incompetent practitioners to move from State to State without disclosure or discovery of previous damaging or incompetent performance. Congress felt that the threat of private money damage liability under Federal laws, including treble damage liability under Federal antitrust law, unreasonably discouraged physicians and dentists from participating in effective professional peer review. Therefore, Congress sought to provide incentive and protection for physicians, dentists, and other health practitioners engaging in effective professional peer review. Prior to establishment of the National Practitioner Data Bank, physicians could readily move from one state to another when they lost their license to practice medicine, when they had major malpractice settlements, and when they were asked to leave the medical staff of a particular community hospital.  With required reporting, all the information is now logged into the NPDB-HIPDB and provider-specific information is available for review by authorized persons. As mandated by the Health Care Quality Improvement Act, the NPDB-HIPDB functions in a self-supportive manner through the collection of user fees. As required, those fees cover the full cost of the NPDB-HIPDB, and no Federal appropriation monies are requested or received (i.e., Federal taxes do not support the Data Banks). User fees are established at a level to cover all program costs to allow the Data Banks to meet short and long term program performance goals. Fees are established based on query volume, in order to ensure adequate revenues are available to cover all program costs.", Summary:"The purpose of the National Practitioner Data Bank-Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (NPDB-HIPDB) is to protect the public, improve the quality of health care, and deter fraud and abuse in the health care system by providing information about past adverse actions of practitioners, providers, or suppliers to authorized health care entities and agencies. The data provided must be current, as the information stored is used by entities to make decisions such as whether to give a medical practitioner a state license or to grant a practitioner clinical privileges. The vision for the NPDB-HIPDB program is to serve as a confidential information clearinghouse to potential employers, enabling them to make better hiring decisions and provide for a better quality health workforce. The NPDB is a flagging system that provides authorized entities with the means to help protect public health by providing vital information that impedes the ability of incompetent health care practitioners to move from State to State without discovery of previous substandard performance or unprofessional conduct. The NPDB discloses to eligible entities information on medical malpractice payments, adverse clinical privileges and licensure, and other adverse actions taken against physicians, dentists, and other health care providers by State licensing authorities, hospitals, and professional societies. The HIPDB was designed to reduce healthcare fraud and abuse by collecting and disclosing to authorized entities information on health care related civil judgments and criminal convictions, adverse licensure and certification actions, exclusions from health care programs, and other adjudicated actions taken against health care providers, suppliers, and practitioners. Under the Affordable Care Act, the HIPDB will be merged into the NPDB, thus ending the duplication of effort and cost between the two Data Banks and allowing users to obtain the same information with a single query. The NPDB-HIPDB supports both The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and HHS' Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) missions by providing key resources to prevent and reduce health care fraud and abuse. Further, the program's performance measures and activities build upon HRSA's strategic plan and are keyed to the agency's goal to improve access to quality health care and services.

The Agency works with the health care community to improve the quality and efficiency in beneficiaries' programs, services, and care, and to promote the fiscal soundness of an evolving health care system in the United States. Today, CMS uses significant data center capacity provided by industry to support the IT Infrastructure requirements of the agency. The Baltimore Data Center (BDC) and the two Enterprise Data Centers, EDC1 and EDC2 are key IT Infrastructure resources utilized by CMS to meet its overall mission. All three data centers are currently operated under two separate contracts which limits competition and impedes coordination across all three of these data centers. CMS will reconcile these issues by bringing the three aforementioned data centers and additional data centers, currently operated outside the auspices of the CMS, Office of Information Services, under the umbrella of a single procurement vehicle. Toward these ends, CMS proposes the development of a comprehensive Virtual Data Center (VDC) ID/IQ that will expand upon concepts garnered from the existing EDC ID/IQ and ESD ID/IQ models.  This investment supports that effort.  Currently there are approximately 100 contractors working for CMS at approximately 200 sites. Under the VDC Strategy, OIS plans to award contracts to multiple companies. The VDC will support ongoing CMS efforts to consolidate CMS data center workloads and to comply with government-wide initiatives for cloud computing by offering cloud-like services through the VDC. The VDC aligns with all four high-level goals of the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (DCCI): promote the use of Green IT by reducing the overall energy and real estate footprint of government data centers, reduce cost of data center hardware, software and operations, increase over IT security posture of the government, and shift IT investments to more efficient computing platforms and technologies. As a result of this approach, we anticipate that all CMS work will be running in a much lower number of data centers within the next ten years.

The investment seeks to achieve these goals by coordinating stakeholders in developing interoperable standards and by engaging industry in developing prototypes and trials. Executive Order 13410 requires Federal Agencies to adopt health IT standards that have been recognized by the HHS Secretary when developing or enhancing health information systems.NwHIN Exchange represents the standards, services and policies necessary to support using the internet to exchange information in a secure and private manner. Initially established as a program under ONC in 2004, the goals of the NwHIN Exchange were to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare by establishing a mechanism for nationwide health information exchange. The NwHIN Exchange went through a prototyping and trial implementations phase where an architecture and set of specifications were developed to provide a common, secure and trusted network to enable the exchange of health information among private networks and Federal health networks. The effort effectively integrated specifications, implementation guidelines, compliance, interoperability verification, and network operations with a strong trust fabric to allow for interoperable health information exchange. CONNECT Gateway is a Federal Health Architecture initiative to develop a software gateway to link Federal Agencies to the NwHIN Exchange. It was built in open source to keep the cost low and make the solution widely available.

With limited staff resources, HPMS is critical to CMS in managing the nearly 800 MA and PDP organizations to ensure that they are fulfilling the significant number of statutory, regulatory, and administrative requirements of the MAPD programs. The HPMS investment contributes to the Transform Health Care goal in the HHS Strategic Plan as well as to the Excellence in Operations and Improving the Care of Individuals goals of the CMS Strategic Action Plan. A primary mission of HPMS is to support the addition of new contract and plan choices to increase the accessibility and availability of drug and health plans to Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, HPMS functionality enables the agency to negotiate with plans for quality benefit packages at a reasonable cost to the beneficiary and the government. Finally, HPMS collects detailed plan benefit data for use in beneficiary education tools and provides for the review and approval of plan marketing materials. These activities ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to accurate and timely data and are well-prepared to select a plan that best suits their individual healthcare needs.This investment also makes significant contributions to an expanded e-government, implementation of the Federal Enterprise Architecture, and CMS' IT modernization blueprint. It builds the basic computing infrastructure needed to support several CMS systems; supports common standards and practices; and integrates security and privacy protections throughout the lifecycle. In addition to maintaining current operations, CMS will enhance the Plan Management Dashboard to add new key performance indicators for plan assessment, re-engineer the formulary submission process to gain efficiencies, and automate the review of retail pharmacy networks to strengthen the application review.", `UNIQUE IMPORT ID`:247});

HIPAA requires the Secretary of HHS to adopt a national standard identifier for all health plans and providers for use in the health care system. This scope extends to all heath plans and providers not just Medicare and Medicaid.  NPPES processes applications from health care providers for National Provider Identifiers (NPIs).  NPIs are identification numbers that health care providers are required by regulation to obtain and use to identify themselves in electronic health transactions, such as electronic claims and eligibility inquiries.  NPIs do not change and do not expire.  NPPES captures identifying information about health care providers.  It processes each application to ensure the uniqueness of the health care provider, and assigns the health care provider an NPI.  NPPES establishes a record for every health care provider it enumerates.  NPPES processes updates and changes to the data in an enumerated health care provider's record and deactivates and reactivates a health care provider's NPI upon request by the health care provider.  NPPES makes available, upon approved requests, information about each enumerated health care provider, including the NPI.  NPPES assists with reducing the incidence of provider misidentification.  It helps to differentiate between fraudulent providers and those who make honest billing mistakes.  It allows for easy access to obtain NPIs.  Finally, it supports defining, developing, implementing, and maintaining uniform data standards for the exchange of health care information in our programs, as well as across the nation's health care system. This system went into production during FY 2006.  NPPES supports HHS & CMS goals such as Expanded E-Government by implementing a web-based application for providers to obtain their NPI, improving system and technology information management, providing efficient business processes, and maintaining data integrity.

The current Risk Adjustment Processing System collects 5 data elements for risk adjustment.  Since CMS doesn't collect MAO enrollees' expenditure data, it has been establishing risk coefficients based on Original Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) claims diagnosis and cost data.  Thus, coefficients used for payment are not the same as those that would be calculated if CMS used MAO-based diagnosis and cost data.  MAOs do not report diagnoses (and perhaps cost) in the same patterns as FFS providers, thus risk scores are overstated and MOAs are overpaid. Without data on the full range of services MAO enrollees receive, CMS is also limited in its ability to review the MA program annual contracting bids and conduct comparative effectiveness research.  The FY 2009 rule (73 FR 48650) reasserted CMS' authority to collect data from MAOs.

As further details are developed, the following scope will be broken out into detailed activities, dates, and cost estimates. This is the first six months of Imports 2 and includes the following. Imports 2 will contain work for Entry Manager (EM), Import Trade Auxiliary Communications System (ITACS), Predictive Rick-based Evaluation and Dynamic Import Compliance Targeting (PREDICT), Prior Notice Manager (PNM), and Customs System Interface (CSI). For EM, this will focus on migrating functionality from the legacy systems Operational and Administrate System for Import Support (OASIS) and Entry Review to support 801(a) screening. For ITACS, this will focus on account management (via Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS)) and additional functionality enabled by logins. For PREDICT, this will focus on building functionality to better manage rules. For PNM and CSI, this will focus on requirements. EM will provide functionality for screening, in conjunction with PREDICT, for the majority of the 20,000,000+ products imported via the 801(a) process annually. This will give import screeners and import compliance officers a unified interface for dealing with all of their work flows, including tracking Field Work (accomplished in Field Work Manager (FWM)). PREDICT is an expert system built around a rules engine that produces a risk-based score of imported products. Products with a low score are automatically sent forward by PREDICT. Products with a higher score require an import screener to review the product by using EM. ITACS is used to interface with import filers and industry to provide a conduit for supporting documentation. This will reduce the current use of phone calls and emails, provide FDA with a more reliable information source and record, and give industry a more efficient way of communicating. Use of this component by industry is voluntary, so it must provide an incentive for external partners. PNM will provide the interface for work flows associated with 801(m) import screening, Prior Notice, which is focused on Food Security and Food Safety. This will replace functionality currently in OASIS. CSI will replace the outdated technology currently used for the interface between FDA and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

This includes an expansion of the licenses for the BPMS (Business Process Management Suite) (including Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)), Oracle Identity Management (IDM) Suite, WebCenter, Oracle Policy Automation (OPA), and Real User Experience Insight (RUEI). The license expansion for the BPMS includes enough licenses for all FDA users. A number of FDA Centers have expressed interest in using this platform for their systems. MARCS has a primary focus on integration across the organization and as the BPMS would help further this goal, these licenses have been expanded to enable organization wide integration. IDM will give MARCS a comprehensive COTS solution to provide the specialized functionality and fine grained security control envisioned. This will require some custom code to realize envisioned functionality. The custom code will be developed under Authorization, Roles, and Responsibilities Management Services (ARRMS) 2 - Supplemental. IDM may also be leveraged as an FDA wide solution in the future. The implementation of IDM will be used by every component within MARCS. This has been vetted with the FDA CIO and HHS CIO and conforms to HHS standard security. WebCenter provides robust user interface and portal capabilities. This COTS will be used to implement User Workspace Enhancement Services (UWES), which is part of the Support Services project. UWES will provide a standardized user experience customized based on user role and single user preferences.
