# Distinguishing features
Focus on UK market


# Frameworks
Multiple price points
Relationships with both sides of the former PPPs
Growth & Building Capability early in cycle 
Straightforward/ non-jargon literature appealing to Council bosses
Identifying the assets and considering their net value through whole-life 
No integrated capability
No evidence of a specific business plan
Survival rather than transformation last year encouraged a particular skill set
Planning for CP5 including second tier stations
Focussing the Public Sector on retaining market efficiencies of the collapsed PPPs

# The drivers of strategy
Start from customers portfolio view 
Understand the pressures on the new leaders (e.g. why HS goes East).
3 month window before the competitor acquisitions become effective
Increasing influence of the Infrastructure Planning commission, the Business Infrastructure Commission and British Chamber of Commerce and Infrastructure UK

# Look for the new types of emerging clients 
The upcoming logistic barons. The work around the ports
The next stage of new IT implementations
The pensions funds looking for secure assets
International work. Follow the BRICs ambassadors
Go in on the back of the big four

# Understand the credibility challenge now on demand & cost forecasting
Even inflation /cost pressures are let even, let alone differential growth
And how to building in the cost of financing. 
So to be credible must make a move. Econometric? Or risk portfolio based? 
Suggest the next ten years is about keeping options for growth and parsimony open 

# Deduction 1: Refocus marketing as Delivery across whole life cycle
This suggests a refocus around the new contracting models
Build a procurement capability
This is the hole in the matrix, yet have a PrM Capability
Refocus round transport hubs, even borders/customs , around the core routes
Sell to the new winners also trying to break into rail, such as FM and airports

# Deduction 2: promote Transport/demand planning as providing a series of clear options
i.e. playing scenarios as options for the Client
fits more with the Operating models emerging in Oil market as response to volatility

# First implementation steps
Accredit appropriate staff in risk and fin models
Start to develop relations with the specialist suppliers coming onto market 
Understand at what scale of the market the gaps exist

# Opportunities
Unit cost base still patchy (see latest NAO) as are the specific reasons for shortfall
The recommended changes in Incentive structure will pull in greater requests for good risk management from clients, with harder efficiency targets, but greater upside for performance

# Forward planning for clients as result of EU white paper (4/11)
Impact of 2010 HM Infrastructure Cost base revision
Applying the lessons from the NR devolution experiment
Some clients will not have identified the impact of some non-critical (but business affecting) effects of the Olympics on a whole financial quarter of their operationsâ€¢	

# External Pressures
Reduced barriers to entry as Business link places all Govt contracts online
Difficult market has created some  niche players that operate at low multiples,
increasingly important to differentiate offering from the Interim Mgt service proposition 
Rail is increasingly difficult environment to deliver in, even DB/ Chiltern failed on Evergreen 

# Applicability of strengths to current market
Commercial & Public Sector experiencing changes, Local Govt needing small/mid interventions rather than Big 4, DWP level changes
Understand both procurement and cost/process rationalisations
