# Which-Graph-app ?

## YEd 

YEd is best for :

- toggling between graph views (e.g. circular or organic)
- forcing a tree view
- exploring a knowledge graph for understanding of individual relationships
- making small edits to node descriptions
- removing links
- creating groups of nodes for convenience
- quick opening and inspection of grapheme files

YEd desktop is most convenient for all of the above
YEd live is great for sharing a graph

## Gephi 

Gephi is best for:

- dragging nodes around to understand the whole graph
- looking for natural groups -
- fast graph analytics -
- spreadsheet like editing of nodes and edges

## Neo4j

Best for 

- long term graph storage and management
- arranging for CSV exports of some /all data
- distinguishing clearly between database schema and instances
- seeing implied data schema
- handling attributes other than node label
